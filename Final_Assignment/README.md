Meet the trained waste-sorting sidekick that's got your back (and your eyesight)! This clever model, trained on over 300 pics and 30 epochs, uses your phone's camera to detect nearby dustbins, because let's face it, finding one can be a real challenge - especially whit you glued to screens all day ðŸ˜‚. Just whip out your phone, fire up the app, and voilÃ ! It'll guide you to the nearest waste container, saving you from awkward encounters like considering your friend's empty head as a dudtbinðŸ˜­. Of course, as with any human-trained model, there's a teeny chance of errors, but hey, it's worth a shot, right?

used vs code, cvat, makesense.ai and Yolov8s to complete this assignment.
<br>
1 para takeaway-
<br>
The jourmey tarted with learning about RGB / BGR and greyscale images and about blurring images using various methods and also applying it on live cam video. Then moving to Yolo and annotations which taught how objects in images are identified by training them using annotated images with their txt files... all this helped me to make and complete my final project.
In this assignment I have created a model to take feed from a camera (or preloaded video/ image) and box out / detect possible dustbins (or waste disposals). I have used yolov8s model to train it using 300 images (238 for train, 62 for validate) and through 30 epochs (still less for accurate prediction). the best.pt model recieved from the training is able to guess it correctly but still has potential to increase in precision as still some errors are visible in it's predictions.
